# Windows Console Monitoring
This is a demonstration version of how to monitoring Windows console (starting from Windows 8). 
The concept was based on the 2-part articles of fireeye blog but souce code wasn't revealed, so i decide to write a POC for my own.
Let me know if you want some more features.

The 2-part articles of fireeye blog can be viewed here:
